## Synopsis

Cub3D is a **C** programming project that aims to create a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective. It utilizes the principles of raycasting to achieve this immersive experience.

## Key Features

- Realistic 3D rendering of a maze
- Raycasting algorithm for creating 3D visuals
- Smooth window management
- Display of different wall textures based on orientation
- Customizable floor and ceiling colors
- Player movement and camera control with arrow keys and WASD
- Map parsing from a scene description file
- Error handling for invalid maps and configurations
- Use of the miniLibX library for graphics rendering

## Why Cub3D?

- **Graphics Programming**: Rendering 3D-like visuals from a 2D map using raycasting; understanding real-time image manipulation.

- **C Programming**: Full project in C; enhancing proficiency in a widely-used language for system-level, embedded programming, and game development.

- **Algorithm Development**: Implementing raycasting and maze-rendering engine; optimizing code and devising efficient solutions.

- **Problem Solving**: Overcoming challenges in user input, textures, and error handling; honing problem-solving skills.

- **3D Mathematics**: Utilizing vector operations, perspective projection, and rotation matrices for achieving 3D visuals.

- **Game Development Concepts**: Implementing player controls, collisions, and interactions; learning game loops and event handling.

- **Version Control**: Using Git for collaborative software development; managing and tracking code changes.

- **Documentation Skills**: Writing detailed project documentation; enhancing technical writing abilities.

- **Debugging and Error Handling**: Identifying and fixing issues in complex software systems; mastering debugging techniques.

- **Library Integration**: Utilizing miniLibX for graphics rendering; integrating external libraries into projects.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone git@github.com:abaiao-r/cub3D.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd cub3D`
3. **Compile the program**: `make`
4. **Run the program**: `./cub3D maps/<rest_of_the_path_to_scene_description.cub>`

> **Note**: example `./cub3D maps/good/square_map.cub`
> Also: some maps are invalid because we needed to test the error messages.
